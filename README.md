Cowell O, Mistry N, Deighton K, Matu J, Griffiths A, Minihane AM, Mathers J, Shannon O, Siervo M. Effects of a Mediterranean diet on blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Journal of Hypertension 39(4): 729-739. doi: 10.1097/HJH.0000000000002667. Available at: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33060448/. 

The SBP (systolic blood pressure) file demonstrates meta-analysis of a continuous outcome. Effect sizes and their respective variance are calculated from different forms of outcome data before meta-analysis is performed and forest plots are generated. Diagnostic tests for outliers and influential cases are also included, as well as subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

The HTN (hypertension) file demonstrates meta-analysis of an odds ratio outcome and manual production of a forest plot.
