# MetaAnalysis
The SBP (systolic blood pressure) file demonstrates meta-analysis of a continuous outcome. Effect sizes and their respective variance are calculated from different forms of outcome data before meta-analysis is performed and forest plots are generated. Diagnostic tests for outliers and influential cases are also included, as well as subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

The HTN (hypertension) file demonstrates meta-analysis of an odds ratio outcome and manual production of a forest plot.
